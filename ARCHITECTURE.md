# Architecture

This file can be used to detail:

* Architecture decisions.
* Future implementation details that cannot (or should not!) be attempted in the allotted time.

## Accessibility
- Highlight colour was too dark for the black text. Text could have been changed to white on hover, but I chose to lighten the background instead.
- "Up" and "down" arrow keys move up and down suggestions, similar to google search bar. Rather than the tabbing that is currently implemented.
- With more context around where this is to be placed, some more semantic html could be used, such as <form> or <nav>
